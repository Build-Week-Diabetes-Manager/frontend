##Proposal

What problem does your app solve? A: Predicts blood sugar levels over the next 24 hours.

Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem? A: Using a data science model to predict when a patient‚Äôs blood sugar levels are abnormal.

What is the mission statement? A: Help diabetic patients monitor and predict healthy blood sugar levels.

##Features

Potential Diabetes related API‚Äôs https://www.programmableweb.com/api/managebgl-diabetes https://developer.dexcom.com/ https://predictbgl.com/api/

Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access? A: With our current data no.

Are you required to pay to use the API? A: Not that we know of at this time.

Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?) A: We have not at this time.


## Project Ambition
Some ambitions for this project were to create an application that allows people to checl their glucose levels. Diabetes Manager was built by Junior Developers implmenting technologys that they've learned.  

##Target Audience

Who is your target audience? Be specific. People with diabetes who are looking for a web application to help track and predict their blood sugar levels.
What feedback have you gotten from potential users? ‚Äúcarb and insulin tracker would be great to have‚Äù
Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How? A: We are currently working on this so we will have an app ready to chow come Thursday.
